So, I've been working on a non-Postman api test suite using Playwright and
typescript, which looks pretty promising and avoids some of the issues with
Postman (hard to version, increasingly pushing features to paid versions
only, the newman test runner no longer actively maintained). I've built
some of the SP TUF flows into it (but not yet in vcs) and ps-api-pa, which
*is* in bitbucket. If anyone wants to check it out, see
https://bitbucket.org/ontsys/ps-api-pa-playwright/src/main/ and let me know
if you want to try it out. There are a couple .env files for dev and qc
that I didn't want to commit

Have you glanced at the oasis Jenkinsfile setup and seen if we can add a
stage into it without too much effort to add a playright step?

[2:39 PM] Brian Mielke

Also have you considered just having this in the ps-api-pa repo, so we
don't have too many repos?   If we can run it from inside the ps-api-pa
repo, it would be better off then we can lock in versions of the tests to
the versions of the code more easily.

The jenkinsfile setup isn't bad at all. My plan was to run it *from* the
ps-api-pa repo, but just by making a reference to it. I think it's better
to keep them separate though. They're very different projects.

[2:42 PM] Adam Kelm

The only thing we need to figure out to get it running in the pipeline
would be how to encrypt/decrypt these .env files for use in the
pipeline...unless we just wanna yolo it and commit the .env files with api
keys etc

It's been a while since I tried tweaking an oasis style Jenkinsfile, which
I have only done so far to modify approver lists.  I recall the stages of
their processes being very built into libraries in their jenksinfiles
instead of how our's are normally more setup fully for the repo in question
with a few calls to common code, (oasis is mostly a call to a lot of common
code with a dash of config)

[2:43 PM] Brian Mielke

Their devops team can help us encrypt/decrypt keys, but AFIAK I think I've
got permissions/access to get the keys setup properly in ps-api-pa for all
stacks but the prod one.
